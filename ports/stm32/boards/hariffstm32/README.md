# VCC GND STM32F407VET6 Mini

MicroPython board definition files for the STM32F407VET6 Mini board from [VCC-GND](http://vcc-gnd.taobao.com).

![board](docs/STM32F407VET6.jpg)

You can buy one for around $12 USD on [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/STM32F407VET6-Mini-version-of-the-core-board-STM32-minimum-system-version/32709285751.html)

Clone the board definitions to your [MicroPython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython) `ports/stm32/boards` folder.

```
cd micropython/ports/stm32/boards
git clone https://github.com/mcauser/VCC_GND_F407.git
```

### Build the firmware:

```
cd micropython/ports/stm32
make BOARD=VCC_GND_F407
```

### Instructions for Mac OSX

To upload, I used a $2 USD [ST-Link V2 clone](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/FREE-SHIPPING-ST-Link-V2-stlink-mini-STM8STM32-STLINK-simulator-download-programming-With-Cover/32242036342.html) with `arm-none-eabi-gdb`

Install packages

```
brew install stlink
brew cask install gcc-arm-embedded
```

Check if ST-LINK V2 device is found.
(plug it into a free USB port)

```
st-info --probe
Found 1 stlink programmers
```

Connect ST-LINK V2 to VCC-GND STM32F407VET6 dev board

```
ST-LINK V2 -- STM32F407VET6
3.3V -------- 3v3
SWDIO ------- DIO
SWCLK ------- SCK
GND --------- GND
```

Open two Terminals, one for `st-util` and the other to compile and upload.

Open the first terminal and run

```
st-util
```

It should say "Listening at *:4242..."

Open the second terminal and run:

```
cd micropython/ports/stm32
make BOARD=VCC_GND_F407
arm-none-eabi-gdb build-VCC_GND_F407/firmware.elf
```

Inside gdb run:

```
(gdb) target extended localhost:4242
(gdb) load
(gdb) exit
```

LEDs will blink as the firmware is uploaded.

Switch back to the `st-util` Terminal

```
Look for "Flash written and verified! jolly good!"
```

Press Ctrl+C to exit

Disconnect ST-LINK from USB
Disconnect ST-LINK from dev board (3V3,SWDIO,SWCLK,GND)

Run MicroPython on the board
Connect to the dev board using Micro USB cable (make sure ST-LINK is disconnected to avoid blue smoke!)

```
screen /dev/tty.usbmodem1412 115200
or
screen /dev/tty.usbmodem1422 115200
```

Not sure which? Use tab completion `screen /dev/tty.usb` Tab Tab.

To exit screen: Ctrl+a Ctrl+\ y

Be sure to eject the PYBFLASH mount before unplugging the board.

Success!

### Flashing via DFU

This board can also be flashed using DFU. To put the board in DFU mode,
disconnect USB, slide the BOOT0 DIP switch (number 2) to the ON position
(towards USB) and reconnect USB.

Now you can flash the board using USB with the command
`make BOARD=VCC_GND_F407 deploy`. Once the board is flashed, slide BOOT0 back
to the original position, disconnect and reconnect USB.

You can use the MicroPython command `pyb.bootloader()` to get into DFU mode
without needing to use the switch.

Currently, you need to unplug and replug the board in order to switch from DFU
mode to regular mode.
